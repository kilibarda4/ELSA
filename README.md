# ELSA - Exceptional Laptops and Supercomputers Always
Graphical User Interface for a PC and Laptops vendor.
You have the ability to add new customers, options(parts) to the store,
as well as build computers, create orders, save/load the Store state.
I used the SWING library for the UI design and followed the Scrum Agile method for the development cycle.

## What I Learned
- Core Java Concepts (Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance)  
- Object-Oriented Approach  
- Graphical User Interfaces  
- File IO  
- Java SWING Library  
- Agile Scrum with Biweekly Sprints  
- Java Design  
- Apache ANT  
 
## Usage
On any device with Apache ANT installed:  
```
$ ant build  

$ java gui/Elsa.java  

```
